## LANGUAGE USED

The language that we used was Java and we have developed the project in IntelliJ IDEA. The SDKs that we use in this case was the 18 one. 

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

A config.json must exist within the program. From there, the admin password can be changed in the admin_password section. 
If the administrator tries to log in with a different password, he/she will not be able to log in. In the same way,
if you want to change the database, all the aspects related to it: port, host, name, username and password can be changed from the same json.
